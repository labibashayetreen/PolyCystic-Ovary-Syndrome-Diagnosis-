# PolyCystic-Ovary-Syndrome-Diagnosis-
# Project Title

Brief description of your project.

## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to the project, including its purpose and goals.

## Data Overview

Describe the dataset you are working with and provide any relevant details.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Patterns of Length of the Menstrual Cycle

- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for the length of the menstrual cycle.

- **Visualization:**
  - Create visualizations such as histograms or box plots to understand the distribution of the length of the menstrual cycle.

### Patterns of BMI

- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - Calculate descriptive statistics for BMI.

- **Visualization:**
  - Use visualizations like histograms or box plots to explore the distribution of BMI.

### Patterns of Irregularity in Menstruation

- **Categorical Analysis:**
  - Explore the distribution of irregularity in menstruation.
  - Create bar charts or pie charts to visualize the proportions of regular and irregular cases.

### Age Distribution

- Explore the distribution of ages in the dataset.
- Create visualizations to understand the age demographics.

## Data Visualizations

Include code snippets for key visualizations:

- Heatmap for the correlation matrix.
- Distribution of follicles in both ovaries.
- Scatter plot of follicles in both ovaries.

## Model Building

### Steps involved in Model Building:

1. Assigning values to features as X and target as y.
2. Split test and training sets.
3. Fitting a vanilla model as the base Random Forest model.
4. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch CV.
5. Fitting the final model.
6. Evaluating the confusion matrix.
7. Evaluating the classification report.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Provide details on the hyperparameter tuning process using GridSearch CV, including the parameters you explored and the best parameters obtained.
