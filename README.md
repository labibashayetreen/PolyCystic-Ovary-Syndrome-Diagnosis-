# PolyCystic-Ovary-Syndrome-Diagnosis-

## Introduction

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent hormonal disorder affecting individuals of reproductive age, characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, elevated androgen levels, and polycystic ovaries. This project is dedicated to advancing our understanding of PCOS through data analysis and machine learning techniques, with the ultimate goal of enhancing diagnostic accuracy and contributing to improved patient care.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to explore and analyze a comprehensive dataset related to PCOS, uncovering patterns, trends, and potential diagnostic indicators. By employing statistical methods, visualizations, and machine learning models, we aim to extract valuable insights that can aid in early detection and personalized treatment strategies for individuals with PCOS.


## Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Delve into features like menstrual cycle length, Body Mass Index (BMI), and irregularities in menstruation for pattern identification and correlation exploration.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate essential statistics, including means, medians, and standard deviations, to understand central tendencies and variations in the dataset.

Model Development: Construct a Random Forest classifier for PCOS diagnosis, employing machine learning techniques and fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Visualization: Generate informative visuals like correlation heatmaps and distribution plots to effectively communicate findings.

Contributions to PCOS Understanding: Contribute insights derived from data analysis to the broader understanding of PCOS, potentially leading to improved diagnostic tools and treatment strategies.
